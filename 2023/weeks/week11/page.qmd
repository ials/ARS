title: "🗓️ Week 11 - Deep Learning for Remote Sensing"
---

In this  week, we will understand how to use CNNs for semantic segmentation of remotely sensed images.


## 👨‍🏫 Lecture Slides 

[DeepNets for Earth Observation data](slides.qmd).

##  Practical exercise

Make sure you save the following notebook in your drive and run it from there *during this class*:

[Semantic segmentation of aerial images with deep network](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1cTYz3ZLpMrtQxXOtVDc-3lhn63SN4TrO?usp=sharing)

##  Informe No. 2

### Task
Select one of these choices:

- 1 - Adapt this week notebook to conduct semantic segmentation on your own imagery;

- 2 - Improve the semantic segmentation notebook using other architecture (e.g UNet, DeepLab);

- 3 - Use other DL toolbox to conduct semantic segmentation on your own imagery.
