# Introduction

TBW

# What's RADAR?

Based on the principle of *echolocation*

RAdio Detection and Ranging

# Basic Radar Operation

A pulse of duration $\tau$ travels at the speed of light $c$

The two-way range distance between antena and target is the velocity times the time delay

Thus, the range distance to the target is $R = \frac {c\tau}{2}$

# The Radar Equation

The power scattered by the target ($Pt$) is  proportional to the power leaving the antena ($P$)  shaped by the antenna gain ($G$) and  reduced by the ratio of backscattering cross-section  ($\sigma$) to the  surface area of a sphere at radius $R$:

$Pt = P * G * \frac{\sigma}{4 * \pi * R**2}$
