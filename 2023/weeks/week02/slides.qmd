# Introduction

TBW

# What's RADAR?

Based on the principle of *echolocation*

RAdio Detection and Ranging

# Basic Radar Operation

A pulse of duration $\tau$ travels at the speed of light $c$

The two-way range distance between antena and target is the velocity times the time delay

Thus, the range distance to the target is $R = \frac {c\tau}{2}$

# The Radar Equation

The power leaving the antena ($\P_t$) is shaped by the antenna gain ($G$) and the properties the observed target ($\sigma$), and is reduced by the surface area of a sphere at radius $R$:

$P_t = PtG \frac{\sigma}{\4\piR**2}$

$\sigma$ is know as the backscattering cross-section. It is also denoted as *RCS*.
