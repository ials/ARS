### Preparing Sentinel-1 Analysis Ready Data in GEE

GEE provides global-scale and analysis-ready earth observation data and the cloud computing infrastructure required for their analysis. 
For SAR imagery, however, Analysis Ready Data (ARD) is a concept that can vary by application. 

While radiometric terrain normalization is a recommended preprocessing step for most applications, may not be conducted due to the absence of reliable DSMs. The Sentinel-1 SAR data ingested in GEE is limited to thermal noise removals, data calibration, multi-looking, and range-doppler terrain correction.

For a range of applications, it is advantageous to do additional preprocessing steps, such as speckle filtering and radiometric terrain normalization. However, expert knowledge is needed to implement the additional preprocessing steps.

Thus, in order to support additional Sentinel-1 SAR data preprocessing in GEE, Adugna Mellisa et al. (2021) proposed a comprehensive framework for preparing Sentinel-1 SAR backscatter ARD in GEE suitable for a wide range of applications. 

### The Mullisa workflow

The implemented framework to get Sentinel-1 ARD includes additional border noise removal, speckle filtering, and radiometric terrain normalization. All the additional preprocessing can be adjusted by the user depending on their specific needs.

### Hands-on exercise

The framework is implemented in both GEE Javascript and the Python application programming interface (API).

To use the framework in GEE code editor, go to [this repository](https://code.earthengine.google.com/?accept_repo=users/adugnagirma/gee_s1_ard) and copy the contents of the *s1_ard.js* script  to your own repository. The path to the preprocessing functions is a public so you don't need to copy them.

When using the Python API, the user should adjust the script path and GEE id to their own path and id before processing.
