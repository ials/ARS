title: "🗓️ Week 8  - Multi_Task Learning "
---

In this  week, we will learn how to implement and train  a **deep multitask model** using Earth Observation data for different downstream tasks such as classification, segmentation, and regression. We will reproduce experiments from the *Efficient Deep Learning EO workshop* (IGARSS 2024).
