title: "🗓️ Week 4  - CNNs for image classification"
---

In this  week, you have to complete two main tasks.


## 👨‍🏫 Task 1

Watch the tutorial [CNN in Deep Learning](https://www.simplilearn.com/tutorials/deep-learning-tutorial/convolutional-neural-network)

## 👨‍🏫 Task 2

Build a convolutional neural network from scratch to classify images into two categories. For such a task, follow each step from this [tutorial](https://thedatafrog.com/en/articles/dogs-vs-cats/)

You can download the *Kaggle Cats and Dogs Dataset* [from here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=54765).

## Assignment

Make sure you complete both tasks within this week. In your PRA notebook, summarize what have you learned from both of them.

## Reading

Read (and take notes) of the article [*Ten deep learning techniques to address small data problems with
remote sensing*](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wGEP-apFKjtBe5XdjpRy9wgtLgpyxTJ1/view?usp=sharing)
